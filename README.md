# rikuerikmaki-c_project_olympics

A C project that I made for a c-programming course in school. 

The program ranks countries based on medals they've earned. Gold medals are the most valuable, then silver and bronze medals are the least valuable.
Example situation: Finland 3 0 2, France 6 2 0, German 6 2 1, England 4 2 2, Sweden 4 3 0 (first number represents the amount of gold, second silver and third bronze medals). Now the program ranks the countries in this order: 

German 6 2 1 <br />
France 6 2 0 <br />
Sweden 4 3 0 <br />
England 4 2 2 <br />
Finland 3 0 2 <br />

As you can see, in tie situation the ranking is done by comparing the next valuable medal.
